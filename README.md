# VyomGarud — Landing Page (v0)

A modern, responsive single-page landing site for VyomGarud — a UAV / drone systems company with a military-grade, professional identity.  
This repository contains a Next.js + Tailwind CSS implementation focusing on a dark, confident, and precise aesthetic.

Status: Draft / v0 — single polished page.

----

## Quick preview
- Hero with bold visual, CTA
- About section with mission summary
- Capabilities / Products (3 cards)
- Highlights (3 concise bullets)
- Contact / Footer with simple form
- Dark, military-futuristic aesthetic using charcoal / white / orange (#ff7b00)
- Subtle animations (CSS)

---

## Tech stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Poppins font (Google Fonts)
- Optional: Framer Motion (if added for animations)
- Package manager: pnpm (pnpm-lock.yaml present)

---

## Colors & Typography
- Primary background / charcoal: #0f1416 (or similar)
- Accent orange: #ff7b00
- Text: white / gray scales
- Fonts: Poppins (primary), fallbacks to Inter/System UI

---

## Design notes
Goals:
- Convey reliability, precision, and advanced autonomy.
- Clean, confident layout with generous spacing and clear hierarchy.
- Slightly military / futuristic styling: strong typographic weight, constrained color palette, subtle tech-style SVG in the hero.
- Reusable components for cards, lists, and forms to keep code organized.

Accessibility:
- Sufficient contrast for primary text
- Semantic HTML sections and landmarks
- Button states and focus outlines preserved

Animations:
- Subtle micro-interactions (hover/press on CTAs)
- Decorative SVG/line animations in hero (CSS or Framer Motion can be used)

## Development tips / suggestions
- Sketch a wireframe before implementing new features or re-styling.
- Keep components small and reusable; use a `components/ui` folder for primitives.
- Prefer utility-first Tailwind classes for speed; extract repeating combos into component classes if they repeat often.
- Use `framer-motion` for entrance/hover micro-animations if you want smoother motion.
- Ensure responsive breakpoints (mobile-first): sm / md / lg / xl.

---

## Design decisions (short)
- Single-page focus: concentrate effort on one polished experience rather than many pages.
- Dark + orange palette: communicates seriousness with a clear accent for CTAs.
- Minimal copy: short, mission-focused language to emphasize reliability and technical capability.
